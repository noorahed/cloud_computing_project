# cloud_computing_project
This project presents a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline designed to process large-scale
 social media streams. By leveraging PySpark for data ingestion, TensorFlowâ€™s RoBERTa model
 for sentiment classification, and Firebase for real-time data storage and visualization, the system
 provides valuable insights into public sentiment. The cloud-native architecture ensures scala
bility and reliability, making it suitable for dynamic environments. The project demonstrates
 the potential of modern NLP techniques in real-time applications, with future work focusing on
 improving sentiment accuracy and expanding data sources.
